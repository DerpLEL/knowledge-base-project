{"prompt": "Answer this question.\n\n\t\tQuestion: what was gregor mendel contribution\n\t\tAnswer: ", "answer": "Gregor Mendel's contribution to science was his discovery of the basic principles of heredity, which are now known as Mendel's laws of inheritance. Mendel's work was published in 1866, but it was not widely recognized until the early 20th century.\n\nMendel's laws of inheritance state that:\n\n1. Each individual has two alleles for each gene, one inherited from each parent.\n2. The alleles for a gene segregate during meiosis, so that each gamete (egg or sperm) receives only one allele for each gene.\n3. The alleles for a gene recombine randomly during fertilization, so that each offspring receives a unique combination of alleles.\n\nMendel's laws of inheritance have been confirmed by numerous experiments, and they are now considered to be the foundation of modern genetics. Mendel's work has had a profound impact on our understanding of heredity and has led to the development of new technologies, such as genetic engineering.", "question": "what was gregor mendel contribution", "actual_answer": "['Monk', 'Botanist', 'Scientist']", "is_correct": false}
