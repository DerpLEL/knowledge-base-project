{"prompt": "Answer this question.\n\n\t\tQuestion: what did niels bohr discover about the atomic structure\n\t\tAnswer: ", "answer": "Niels Bohr discovered the atomic structure by proposing a model that describes the atom as a small, dense nucleus surrounded by electrons that orbit the nucleus in discrete energy levels. This model, known as the Bohr model of the atom, was a significant advancement in the understanding of atomic structure and laid the foundation for the development of quantum mechanics.", "background_triples": "- (Niels Bohr, Niels Bohr's atomic model, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Bohr model of the atom, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Electron configuration, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Energy levels, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Atomic orbitals, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Quantum numbers, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Wave-particle duality, Quantum mechanics)\n- (Niels Bohr, Uncertainty principle, Quantum mechanics)\n- (Niels Bohr, Complementarity principle, Quantum mechanics)", "question": "what did niels bohr discover about the atomic structure", "actual_answer": "['Quantum mechanics']", "is_correct": true}
