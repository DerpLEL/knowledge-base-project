{"prompt": "Answer this question.\n\n\t\tQuestion: what did f. scott fitzgerald do\n\t\tAnswer: ", "answer": "F. Scott Fitzgerald was an American author and one of the foremost writers of the Jazz Age. He is best known for his novels The Great Gatsby, Tender Is the Night, and This Side of Paradise, as well as his short stories. Fitzgerald was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on September 24, 1896. He attended Princeton University, where he met his future wife, Zelda Sayre. After graduating from Princeton, Fitzgerald worked as an advertising copywriter before publishing his first novel, This Side of Paradise, in 1920. The novel was a critical and commercial success, and Fitzgerald quickly became one of the most popular writers of his generation. In 1925, Fitzgerald published The Great Gatsby, which is considered one of the greatest American novels of the 20th century. The novel tells the story of Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire who throws lavish parties in an attempt to win back the love of his life, Daisy Buchanan. The Great Gatsby was a critical and commercial success, and it cemented Fitzgerald's reputation as one of the most important writers of his time. Fitzgerald continued to write throughout the 1920s and 1930s, but his later work was not as well-received as his earlier novels. He died of a heart attack in Hollywood, California, on December 21, 1940, at the age of 44.", "kaping_triples": "(F.
