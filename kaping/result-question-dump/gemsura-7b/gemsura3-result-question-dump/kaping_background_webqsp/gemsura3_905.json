{"prompt": "Answer this question.\n\n\t\tQuestion: what did niels bohr discover about the atomic structure\n\t\tAnswer: ", "answer": "Sure, here is your answer:\n\nNiels Bohr discovered the concept of the Bohr model of the atom, which describes the structure of an atom and predicts the properties of electrons in it.\n\nAccording to the Bohr model, electrons in an atom occupy a series of shells, or electron orbits, around the nucleus. The electrons are in constant motion around the nucleus, and their energy increases as they move further from the nucleus. The electrons are bounded in these shells by the electric attraction between them and the nucleus", "kaping_triples": "(Bohr, notable work, Bohr model of the atom), (Bohr model of the atom, named after, Bohr), (Niels Henrik David Bohr, notable work, quantum theory), (Niels Henrik David Bohr, award received, Nobel Prize in Physics), (Max Born, notable work, Bohr model of the atom), (Arnold Sommerfeld, notable work, Bohr model of the atom), (Niels Bohr Institute, inception, 3 March 1921), (Niels Henrik David Bohr, date of birth, 7 October 1885), (Enrico Fermi, notable work, Bohr model of the atom), (Niels Henrik David Bohr, father, Christian Bohr)", "background_triples": "- (Niels Bohr, Niels Bohr's atomic model, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Bohr model of the atom, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Electron configuration, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Energy levels, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Atomic orbitals, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Quantum numbers, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Wave-particle duality, Quantum mechanics)\n- (Niels Bohr, Uncertainty principle, Quantum mechanics)\n- (Niels Bohr, Complementarity principle, Quantum mechanics)", "question": "what did niels bohr discover about the atomic structure", "actual_answer": "['Quantum mechanics']", "is_correct": false}
