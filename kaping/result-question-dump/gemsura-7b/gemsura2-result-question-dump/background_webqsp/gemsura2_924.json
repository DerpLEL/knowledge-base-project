Its primary contribution is the mathematical description of motion and gravitation. This theory revolutionized the scientific understanding of the universe and laid the groundwork for modern-day physics.\n\nIt is divided into two main pillars of scientific understanding:\n\n<b>Motion and Equilibrium</b>:\nThis pillar covered the concepts of inertia, motion, acceleration, velocity, and equilibrium. This theory describes the motion of objects as a fundamental", "background_triples": "- (Sir Isaac Newton, Theory, Physics)\n- (Sir Isaac Newton, Theory, Gravity)\n- (Sir Isaac Newton, Theory, Motion)\n- (Sir Isaac Newton, Theory, Calculus)\n- (Sir Isaac Newton, Theory, Optics)\n- (Sir Isaac Newton, Theory, Astronomy)\n- (Sir Isaac Newton, Theory, Mathematics)", "question": "what is sir isaac newton theory", "actual_answer": "[\"Newton's law of universal gravitation\"]", "is_correct": false}
