Each electron orbital is characterized by a set of four quantum numbers: the principal quantum number, the azimuthal quantum number, the magnetic quantum number, and the spin quantum number.\n\nEach electron orbital is associated with a specific energy state, which is determined by the principal quantum number. Electrons can move between energy states by absorbing", "background_triples": "- (Niels Bohr, Niels Bohr's atomic model, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Bohr model of the atom, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Electron configuration, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Energy levels, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Atomic orbitals, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Quantum numbers, Atomic structure)\n- (Niels Bohr, Wave-particle duality, Quantum mechanics)\n- (Niels Bohr, Uncertainty principle, Quantum mechanics)\n- (Niels Bohr, Complementarity principle, Quantum mechanics)", "question": "what did niels bohr discover about the atomic structure", "actual_answer": "['Quantum mechanics']", "is_correct": false}
