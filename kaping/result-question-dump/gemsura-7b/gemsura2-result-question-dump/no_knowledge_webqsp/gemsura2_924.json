{"prompt": "Answer this question.\n\n\t\tQuestion: what is sir isaac newton theory\n\t\tAnswer: ", "answer": "Sure, here's the answer:\n\nSir Isaac Newton's Theory is the mathematical description of gravity that profoundly influenced the scientific understanding of the universe. Newton's theory unified the concepts of motion and gravitation into a single mathematical framework, thereby paving the way for Einstein's theory of relativity. The Newtonian gravitational law states that the acceleration of an object is proportional to the net force applied to that object. The force of gravity is described mathematically by the power-law relationship F = GmM/", "question": "what is sir isaac newton theory", "actual_answer": "[\"Newton's law of universal gravitation\"]", "is_correct": false}
