{"prompt": "Answer this question.\n\n\t\tQuestion: what did niels bohr discover about the atomic structure\n\t\tAnswer: ", "answer": "The answer is that the electron exists in quantized energy states and that electrons in an atom tend to occupy the lowest available energy state, thus forming electron shells around the nucleus. Not only that, the electrons in these electron shells radiate stationary waves, which is the source of the quantized energy states.", "question": "what did niels bohr discover about the atomic structure", "actual_answer": "['Quantum mechanics']", "is_correct": false}
