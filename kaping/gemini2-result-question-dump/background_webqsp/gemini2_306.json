He was the Chosen One, a powerful Force-sensitive individual who was prophesied to bring balance to the Force. Anakin was born on the planet Tatooine to Shmi Skywalker, a slave. He was discovered by Qui-Gon Jinn, a Jedi Master, who believed that Anakin was the Chosen One. Anakin was trained as a Jedi by Qui-Gon and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin was a skilled and powerful Jedi, but he was also arrogant and impulsive. He was seduced by the dark side of the Force by Darth Sidious, the Sith Lord who was secretly controlling the Galactic Republic. Anakin turned to the dark side and became Darth Vader, a ruthless and powerful Sith Lord. Vader served Sidious as his apprentice and helped him to establish the Galactic Empire. Vader was responsible for the deaths of many Jedi, including his former master, Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, Vader was eventually redeemed by his son, Luke Skywalker, and he sacrificed himself to save Luke from Sidious.", "background_triples": "- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's father, Darth Vader)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's mother, Shmi Skywalker)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's wife, Padmé Amidala)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's children, Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's master, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's apprentice, Ahsoka Tano)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's friends, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Padmé Amidala, Ahsoka Tano)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's enemies, Darth Vader, Emperor Palpatine)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's home planet, Tatooine)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's occupation, Jedi Knight, Sith Lord)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's species, Human)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's birth date, 41.9 BBY)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's death date, 4 ABY)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's height, 1.88 meters)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's weight, 84 kilograms)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's eye color, Blue)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's hair color, Blond)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's skin color, Fair)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's lightsaber color, Blue, Red)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's Force abilities, Telekinesis, Telepathy, Force Lightning)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's weaknesses, Arrogance, Impulsiveness)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's strengths, Courage, Determination)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's personality, Impulsive, Passionate)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's motivations, To protect the ones he loves, To become the most powerful Jedi)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's fears, Losing the ones he loves, Failing to become a Jedi)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's dreams, To become a great Jedi, To have a family)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's regrets, Turning to the dark side, Killing Obi-Wan Kenobi)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's accomplishments, Defeating Count Dooku, Destroying the Death Star)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's failures, Turning to the dark side, Losing to Obi-Wan Kenobi)\n- (Anakin Skywalker, Anakin Skywalker's legacy, The Chosen One, The Father of Darth Vader)", "question": "who was anakin skywalker", "actual_answer": "['Ted Bracewell']", "is_correct": false}
