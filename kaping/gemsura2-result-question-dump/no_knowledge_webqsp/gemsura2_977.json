Here is your answer:\n\nBigos is a term used to describe various tar balls that spontaneously combust. Many different substances and temples can produce bigos. The principle of entropy dictates that any such structure will spontaneously dissipate its potential energy and evolve over time into a state with maximum entropy, which, in this case, makes the tar balls much easier to ignite. The energy required to condense matter into specific structures, such as spheres or balls, is enormous. Over time, entropy will break such", "question": "what are bigos", "actual_answer": "['Stew']", "is_correct": false}
